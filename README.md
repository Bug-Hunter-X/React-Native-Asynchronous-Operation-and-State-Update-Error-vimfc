# React Native Asynchronous Operation and State Update Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native related to asynchronous operations and state updates.  The example showcases how to correctly handle asynchronous calls within `componentDidMount` to prevent `setState` calls after component unmount and subsequent warnings or unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The initial `bug.js` file contains a `fetch` call within `componentDidMount`.  Since `fetch` is asynchronous, if the component unmounts before the `fetch` completes and updates the state, a warning (or worse, an error) can occur.  The problem is that the component is trying to update the state after it has been unmounted.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` uses an AbortController to handle the case where the component unmounts before the fetch call completes.  This prevents potential warnings and ensures state updates only happen when the component is still mounted.
